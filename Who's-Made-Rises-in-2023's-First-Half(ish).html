      <h1>Who's Made Rises in 2023's First Half(ish)</h1>
      <h3>Written by<a href="https://twitter.com/FemmeboiRoy"> <c>@Motobug_</c></a></h3>
      <p>NOTE: This was written before the conclusion of PM Concert, so no results from that event will be factored in here.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Ah, rankings season. While PM doesn’t do midyear rankings, mostly due to a much lesser depth of events compared to mainline Smash games, seeing those rankings come out always gets me in the spirit. Thus, I’ve decided to take a bit of time to highlight some of the players that have made significant rises over the first part of 2023. This won’t be everyone, of course (plenty of players have made their case for sure), but I’ll cover the most notable ones that I can think of.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Cloudburst</h2>
        <div class="video-con">
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vPJh-WVApA8?si=YKIrB_wjPvQSfpOo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="1" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
         </div>
        <p>Cloudburst has always been a bit of a sleeper on PMRank, traditionally hovering in the higher end of the 30s. However, the Cloud we’ve been seeing this season has been nothing short of groundbreaking. His most notable event so far has been Mile High Club, where he stormed through Ivayne, Kycse, Pikmon, and Motobug to earn 5th place at the largest event this year. He’s also won Carnival Clash, also over Pikmon, and Smash Camp over Stude and ilovebagelz. With wins on ORLY and CP9 at his other events this year to top it off, there’s no doubt that the Arizona native will far surpass his previous rankings - and might even be the best Squirtle in 2023.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Chaloopy</h2>
        
        <div class="video-con">
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EOvBE2tJag0?si=Km3ISpu8NDuL8ubS" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="1" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
         </div>
        <p>The terror of the midwest, Chaloopy has made his mark on the national scene in 2023, even more so than last year. While he would fall early at JBB2 to the breakout performances of guttey and Boat, he would see nothing but Top 8 finishes at the remainder of his events. He’s racked up wins on the PMRank hopefuls of Star, Samantha, and Stude, while fending off his fellow ranked players in Thalia, ORLY, Cloudburst and Pikmon. He notably won Construct Beta just a day after his mediocre JBB2, taking out Potatoes, Mr. Watch & Learn, Lunchables, and Motobug in the process. His #22 debut last season was already impressive, but the Chaloopy of 2023 is looking to easily break into the top 20.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>metroid</h2>
        <div class="video-con">
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SVlgq2stYBY?si=WFDg-AMP-x3kLKB2" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="1" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
         </div>
        <p>Like his fellow Illinois player Chaloopy, metroid has also set out to continue his rise in 2023. While also having a disappointing JBB2 to his standards, 2022’s #32 redeemed himself at Mile High Club, defeating Qtip, Sneez, and Nogh for a very impressive 9th place at the stacked national. He’s also earned wins on the Falcon duo of ORLY and Chaloopy, and traded sets with Motobug at Construct Beta. While he unfortunately had to miss out on Warp Zone 2, I’m sure Brian isn’t done taking names this year quite yet.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Shiny Zubat</h2>
        <div class="video-con">
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yk5gDOg-A94?si=Ak7sMjWUCko87OKo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="1" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
         </div>
         <p>If you haven’t been paying attention to some of the smaller events this season, this may come as a bit of a surprise to you - but Shiny Zubat has a strong case as a top 25 player right now. While his debut at Lake George Snowdown was underwhelming, both of the New York regionals he’s attended since have been his best events in years. Between the two events, the longtime Yoshi main defeated Thalia, Switch, Gallo, AssTAStic twice, and most notably Malachi - though he’d end up losing the tournament to him later on. If we see a performance similar to these at this year’s Blacklisted, expect one of Yoshi’s best major placements in a long time.</p>
         <br>

         <h2>Motobug</h2>
         <p>[…am I allowed to talk about myself? That cool? I’ll make it quick, and in third person, for immersion’s sake.]</p>
         <div class="video-con">
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s2xv3TTU3q8?si=RTyj5F6nVz6jqlZn" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="1" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
         </div>
         <p>While Motobug hasn’t been able to attend as many events as usual, mainly due to a trip to Australia during Invincible VII and Warp Zone 2, the events they have shown up to have been nothing short of stellar. They’d start out the year with January’s double header of JBB2 and Construct Beta, taking down guttey, Mr. Watch & Learn, Boat, Star, metroid, Chaloopy, and most notably Lunchables for 5th and 2nd place at the events. Their only other major so far, Mile High Club, saw them defeat Star (again), a red-hot Dr. Grin, and fellow Massachusetts titan Flarp for top 8 at the stacked national. With an already strong resume of wins, and plans to attend a few more events before the season’s end, Moto’s looking to break into the top 20 for 2023.</p>
         <br>
         
         <h2>Phresh</h2>
         <div class="video-con">
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d8Agp4vUyqs?si=E5WUYW5oO_WIBiaW" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="1" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
         </div>
         <p>When Phresh began registering for events again, we weren’t quite sure where he’d land in the meta. While the pioneer of Bag Season has been ranked highly in the past, even his heights of years past can’t hold a candle to his incredible 2023 so far. Phresh has firmly cemented himself as a top player once again, winning Lake George Snowdown over AssTAStic, Flarp, Kycse, Malachi, and dvd (twice!), as well as a top 8 finish at Mile High Club with wins over metroid and Pikmon. With his best-in-class usage of PNT and overall excellent execution, Phresh has become a threat to any player who may cross his bracket path, and is looking to end the year with a top 10 finish. </p>
         <p>These have just been a few of the players who have made their rise to the top level over the course of 2023 so far, though of course there are plenty more who have exciting storylines of their own. Shoutouts to Star, Darc, Samantha, polear, flatline, and Stude as just some of the PMRank hopefuls making their mark on the scene this season!</p>
         <br>

         <p>Colorado has been getting more powerful with every season that passes and there are a lot of players to watch out from the local to the national level. From older players like CoJoe, Steel Kangaroo, and Jr Chaffles, to newer players like Polear, Whoratio, and Shwang, The Bigger Mile High Club is bound to have even more stunning results from the home region this coming year.</p>
