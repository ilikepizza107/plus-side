      <h3>Written by<a href="https://twitter.com/FemmeboiRoy" target="_blank"> <p class="articleLink">@FemmeBoiRoy</p></a></h3>
      <p>I guess I should start out with how I got introduced into the P+ community. During quarantine, my best friend wanted to show me a “silly smash mod” for Brawl to fill some of our downtime. They told me about how they used to play it a ton and that I may really like it, that they’d even just play “SoPo”, a character they didn’t know to make it easier on me. So we booted up their Wii and I started learning P+ [Though, for a few weeks it was 3.6 technically]. A little while after we started and I decided I wanted to learn how to play a little more competitively, won my first “pizza match BO5” vs her SoPo and figured I needed a tag. Since I was set on playing Roy at the time, I settled on FemboyRoy. After a little while, we figured that if we were careful (since this was still during quarantine), we could go to a local. So we downloaded P+ and I got my first experience down at the Lone Tree Hub. After a small lul with needing to switch venues, we ended up at LocalHost for the Denver weekly and had access to such an amazing venue.</p>

      <p>After a little bit of time, the idea got floated of using the amazing venue we had to run a bigger event like a regional. I wrote way more about this and how Colorado has grown as a scene in a prior article I wrote for PlusSide about Mile High Club. Before Mile High Club was even over, I had the date locked in for “MHC 2”. 4/20/2024 in Denver, CO.

        <br>

        <p>There's a certain mix that me and Alex brought to the table in planning events and for what would soon be The Bigger Mile High Club. Alex had the wisdom of doing this for a long time, and I had the drive as a newer TO to stay up late talking to international players, and coordinating with Level1 to get Devon out for the event. So the day after Mile High Club was over, we started planning the next one. Alex texted me about how we could do it bigger and better and that lit a fire in me.</p>
        <img onclick="ToggleZoom('reImg2')" id="reImg2" class="article-body-image-bigger" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkzstar/plus-side/main/images/Article-images/mile-high-article/Vb3auaSi.jpeg" alt="" tabindex="0">

        <p>With this new fire inside me, we brainstormed a list of people to reach out to. Some of which were Donkos, Ryzuul, Poilu, and old heads from every state. My work began again, with thankfully over a year of time ahead of me this time. Starting with the furthest distance and working my way closer. I began reaching out to people about the event. With Mile High Club getting noticed across the ocean and NotFete coming up, P+ was on the minds of a lot of people. At this point, I would like to shout out Ryzuul, Adray, and Smash_Falco3 for committing to coming before the start.gg was even up. Also much love for Poilu, who couldn’t make it but absolutely helped talk up the previously named “Mile High Club 2” in many of the international discords.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p>As me and Alex were driving home from The Back Hit, we were joking around that Mile High Club 2 was not a good enough name. So what do we call it? Mile higher Club? The Club? Club 2, a good day to Club Hard? Then one of us said, "oh wait, The Bigger Mile High Club" and we couldn't stop laughing. Which in turn, solidified that this would be the new name for the event.
        </p>

        <p>Once again, my marketing degree became useful again and again. After having interest in the international community, I made it a point to keep TBMHC on people's minds. Within 2 months of the event ending, TIA produced a killer save the date trailer. As people were asking for another, I was able to put out a trailer and go, “Well hey, don’t you want to come to Colorado for a P+ event on silly weed day?” and the answer was a resounding “Yes”.</p>

        <p>With the downtime between the save the date and the next trailer. We were blessed by people talking about the event and making p+ related videos so that it didn’t have the chance to leave people's minds. Thank you <a id="articleLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcjwCKYbU0U">PM Nexus</a>, <a id="articleLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=we6zN39Wjl0&t=19s">Thunderz</a>, and <a id="articleLink" href="https://youtu.be/EOvJKWuKAiM?si=2zdahcelfBcnoiuh">TurndownforWalt</a> for all the coverage. Thank you to Plus Side for also letting me write an article about Colorado to hype up the host region and get everyone excited for the next event!</p>

          <p>Promotion from here was critical. The next trailer had to get people excited again. With the heavy homage to The Balcony and its classic events, I was luckily able to get some footage from one of the old events to make people start to associate the two. Throwing in footage from Olympus and other pre-covid events as well was just icing on the cake. I used this along with some creativity to elicit the feeling of this event being what all the time and training was for. All the skill and effort you put into the game was to show up to TBMHC and make waves. This was the post covid event that’s going to be the next generation of player’s version of the Balcony.</p>

         <p>When we were around 60 entrants in December, Bad Bully came in clutch asking if we needed another promo trailer.This trailer alone spiked us up another 20 entrants within a week. She has an incredible skill at editing and accomplished their vision with ease. With a Beastie Boys style song, and a massive list of competitors at the highest skill level, Nate had all he needed to make a killer trailer. They absolutely helped us get a ton of new entrants and people talking about trying to make it out.

         <p>Wisely created the perfect storm for us too, having released his video about <a id="articleLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYLAEpYRA9c&t=180s">Project M shadow majors</a> only a week or 2 before, old-school events were exactly what people were nostalgic for. As the new year came around, we hit triple digits and were in the closing stretch for hitting the cap.
        </p>

         <p>The final few promotional ideas were doing a graphic for character representation after me and Ultradil joked around about if I could get representation of every character from the game. So I figured we make that to encourage people to “get their character on the board”, then a graphic for the density of players from each state, and a huge shout out to the now 6 international players signed up. Yador made such a splendid graphic for the event, highlighting all the character representations and their unique skins. It made me tear up a little when everyone was so excited for it and all the “Hey!! There I am!” comments we got. This made us hit our cap in no time.</p>

         <img onclick="ToggleZoom('reImg4')" id="reImg4" class="article-body-image-bigger" src="https://github.com/pkzstar/plus-side/blob/main/images/Article-images/tbmhc/mile%20high%20yador.png?raw=true" alt="" tabindex="0"> 
         
         <p>The icing on top of all the promotion was still finishing out with 2 graphics, one to highlight all the regions coming out, since multiple of them hitting double digits, and one to highlight the international players. All this together was really bottling lightning. I don’t think if there ever was another MHC (an Even Bigger Mile High Club or whatever), that I could recapture the energy that went into planning this event. It was hard and a lot of work. I am so proud of every bit of it but it would be a massive toll on myself to assume I could immediately replicate the perfect storm that I had in front of me.</p>
         <img onclick="ToggleZoom('reImg5')" id="reImg5" class="article-body-image-bigger" src="https://github.com/pkzstar/plus-side/blob/main/images/Article-images/tbmhc/The_Bigger_Mile_High_Club_KEY.png?raw=true" alt="" tabindex="0">

         <p>The event itself went better than I could have imagined. As someone who is always prepared for the worst, one setup being a little on the fritz is exponentially better than what happened last year. Having 44 setups was also such a perk, no matter the event, we always had the ability to have people playing friendlies which was a huge upside for both years. In addition, having the project and couches again, coupling with Level 1’s production value really made this event so unique.</p>
         <img onclick="ToggleZoom('reImg6')" id="reImg6" class="article-body-image-bigger" src="https://github.com/pkzstar/plus-side/blob/main/images/Article-images/tbmhc/tbmhcgroup.png?raw=true" alt="" tabindex="0">

         <p>Day 1 went so much better than with Mile High Club. We were so lucky to be able to leave the setups from the pre-local at the venue this year, so we were able to hit the ground running. It was such a cool sight to watch people who weren’t at Mile High Club or the pre-local walk into the venue and realize just how big LocalHost actually is. The venue used to be a whole grocery store and now it has a huge amount of floor space for people to be able to space out. Having two streams this year was also splendid. Not only being able to provide us with over 100 VODs between the pre-local and main event, but also to highlight some of the amazing talent in this community.</p>

         <p>One tiny moment I wanted to talk about is, getting dinner after day 1. It was me, Autumn, Rye, Qynn, Alex, and Tanner. As we’re getting dinner at Pete’s Kitchen, before I even started to export VODs for day 1, I opened twitter and saw an outpouring of love. I didn’t imagine running this event would surmont to so many people were excited about the second day. Autumn can attest to me tearing up over my Chorizo Burrito and feeling so thankful that this was how the event was going.</p>
         <img onclick="ToggleZoom('reImg7')" id="reImg7" class="article-body-image-bigger" src="https://github.com/pkzstar/plus-side/blob/main/images/Article-images/tbmhc/tbmhcgroup5.jpg?raw=true" alt="" tabindex="0">

         <p>I think, now sitting almost three weeks out from the event, it is important to be introspective on everything and reflect. Running an event like this makes you known to a whole lot of people really quickly and while I put on a persona of being social and having a huge amount of energy for people, I am incredibly socially anxious. A constant battle I had with myself is overcoming what notions people had of me. There wasn’t a single event that I went to that I didn’t hear, “Oh you’re FemboyRoy,” which is scary to a person who is at their first major ever, then daunting at every other event. I changed my tag to try and get away from it some, sure I hosted a huge event but I would like to be known so differently than for just that. There was a massive conversation I had to have with myself, there was a huge part of me wrestling with an internal loss of identity no longer being identified as a furry/therian or artist or queer but as a TO and a smasher.</p>
         <br>
         <img onclick="ToggleZoom('reImg8')" id="reImg8" class="article-body-image-bigger" src="https://github.com/pkzstar/plus-side/blob/main/images/Article-images/tbmhc/tbmhcgroup1.png?raw=true" alt="" tabindex="0">

         <p>In this same vein, there were parts of me that were stifled while being a TO. I lost time with my partners due to needing to handle issues, I couldn’t make art or even really feel like I had time to myself. I don’t regret it, I put on an amazing event because of it, I got to see so many friends and loved ones but it did take a toll. I am so blessed that both my partners have an ocean of understanding for me and allowed me the time I needed to handle things.</p>

         <p>The hardest part of all this is knowing when enough is well, enough. I know myself and my drive to do things like this. There isn’t a, “we replicate the year before,” it’s a, “we do better or we don’t do it”. I think I did well enough for both these events. I need to respect how burnt out I feel and how doing this again would be putting gasoline on burnt wood and praying to have a bonfire. I cannot healthily make an event that is bigger or better than what I did. My goal with TBMHC is to give everyone an event that feels like the old days, like The Balcony, Olympus, and bring back some of the old players and matches, and I did that. I wanted the P+ era of new players to have an event that felt immaculate, like a moment out of time, and there were so many people who it sounded like they absolutely did.</p>
         <img onclick="ToggleZoom('reImg9')" id="reImg9" class="article-body-image-bigger" src="https://github.com/pkzstar/plus-side/blob/main/images/Article-images/tbmhc/tbmhcgroup2.png?raw=true" alt="" tabindex="0">

         <p>I’ve gently breezed over it earlier but I’ve already been asked the question, will there be another MHC? I think for now, for the next unknown amount of time, the answer is no. I think there's too much I need to do for myself before I can even consider running another event like that. I spent the last 2 years neglecting myself to plan events and that's just unfair to me. I became sober during the planning for TBMHC and the stressful days were a struggle to keep working on myself to maintain that sobriety. Sobriety in and of itself is hard. Sobriety while trying to manage international players, venue, staff, a commentary schedule, who is straying at whose house, equipment, and more, is even harder. I have so many personal goals like finishing my 2nd book, better overall health, and so much more that I just cannot balance with trying to TO another event. I need to be able to take care of myself without relying on substances and right now, I can’t. I need to spend this next chapter of my life focusing on me, I want to make sure I can be around for my friends and the community as much as possible and to do that, I need to be healthy. I just need to love myself a little harder than I have been.
        </p>
                 <p>I want to go to events where my whole drive of being there was to just see my friends. All the events I went to that were Smash related revolved around talking up MHC/TBMHC, which feels massively neglectful of my actual desires of being at an event like that. I think for the future of myself and P+, just imagine me as a fox in a park a little too far into a city. If you see me, it’ll be a small nice moment, but never to be quite expected.</p>

         <p>If you want an event like Mile High Club to happen. I believe in you to make it. I was just some chick who wanted something to happen and did it. That's all any of us are, just some people with a passion. So if you truly want to see that event become real, I believe in you. You can do it, ask your local TOs, ask national TOs, you can reach out to me for tips and advice. All our top players are just people with a passion, talk to them, ask them to come to your event. I am sure you can make an even better event.</p>
         <br>
         <p>In the final parts of this article, I would like to cry over what amazing help I had from my friends. I am so blessed to have you all in my life. You are the reason why both of these events happened. I honestly really just wanted a reason to get you all in the same room as me so that I could hug you and tell you how much I missed you. I’m sorry I was way busier this year but hopefully the event gave you an everlasting memory that can compensate for me needing to run around like I did. LocalHost has always been an amazing venue with a sweet spot for P+ and I am eternally grateful for them. There are so many people I have to thank for this event and I went through a ton of them in a thread on twitter but I want to once again thank Alex. If it wasn’t for sitting in your room during quarantine playing this silly mod, these events would have never happened.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Also you, for showing up, for reading this, for being encouraging. An event is nothing without people in attendance. This was all for you!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>So hey, Thanks ❤️</p>
