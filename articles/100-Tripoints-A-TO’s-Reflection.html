      <p>Hey kids. I’ve been running P+ at Tripoint Smash for two and a half years. If you’ve been in the PM scene for any amount of time (god, we’re all old what happened), you’ll know that’s not terribly long, but I can also count helping out with Bloomington-Normal events, like ISmashU weeklies or running tiny events out of a card shop in La-Salle, Illinois.</p>

      <p>Illinois State Smash has been ongoing since 2014 (s/o’s to Maddy)</p>
        <br>
        <p>My first exposure to the community was a <a id="articleLink" href="https://smashboards.com/threads/retribution-october-20th-cincinnati-oh-mk-banned-regional.328952/" target="_blank">Cincinnati Brawl regional</a>  in 2012 and my first foray into TOing was helping out my local library with teen program tournaments. I’d hesitate to call that organizing; Brawl Ike dittos in which fsmash is the primary movement option isn’t exactly peak competition. But I enjoyed helping make these event happen and helped out here and there where I could at Blo-No events (s/o’s to <a id="articleLink" href="https://www.start.gg/tournament/neo-tussle-city/" target="_blank">Neo Tussle City</a>). But I only really started taking on a role in the community beyond toting setups in 2019 when I started helping out at TPS; some of you might remember me running front desk for like 9 months pre-covid.</p>
        <p>Before that though, I hadn’t really entered anything for a year and change, except the occasional ISU bracket or ASH@WIT. In 2019, I was helping out on the side while still entering P+ (and getting so frustrated because for some reason, you need to also practice this damn game to be consistent??), and it took a few months before I stopped entering and only helped out. God, that was the most freeing experience: Show up, help set up, run desk, play friendlies, stop before getting frustrated. Bless.</p>
        
        <br>
        <p>Going into 2020, I wouldn’t enter brackets except on rare occasions and was focusing more and more on helping UGS at TPS and other events (s/o’s to Thwacked). Then very shortly before quarantine, we reached the <a id="articleLink" href="https://www.start.gg/tournament/tripoint-smash-100/" target="_blank"> 100th Tripoint</a>. As a lot of you are aware, that “weekly” was fucking enormous; our lil venue had 100 entrants in PM alone and me and Jack (of the Pseudo variety) ran that without a mic for the first 45 minutes and on god I thought we were going to be there until TPS 200 rolled around.</p>
        <p>It felt great to get that bracket moving though, and even though we went as obscenely late as expected, it was fun and everybody had a great time and PM was huge and then fuckin whoops quarantine hit by the next TPS.</p>

        <p>Tripoint 100 had 100 P+ entrants and took 300 years to run</p>
        <br>

        <p>Quarantine was a lot. Nobody wants to go over that. I’m gonna move on.
          <br>
          <br>
          By summer of 2021, Maddy wanted to take a step back from weeklies (which was beyond justified; she’d been running weekly events since 2014 or 15, she TO’d my first damn ISU tourney ffs, she’d long since needed a break). Nobody else on the UGS team was anywhere as invested in PM (and Melee too I guess UGGHH (jk ily2 melee)). Well, apart from me, having entered my first P+ tourney in mid-2013, and never stopped playing.</p>
        

         <p>So I took over PM at TPS starting with 101! With fuck-all interest in competing, but an enjoyment for organizing and helping out at TPS, I was more than happy to help keep PM alive here. The timing would be really funny if it weren’t for the global pandemic, but we roll. It was a bit of a learning curve for sure, but the rest of UGS has always been there to help and is easily the best crew of TOs and streamers anyone could literally ever ask for. Like I cannot stress that enough, this whole damn article could be about how they made everything from Undertow 1 to Symphony not just possible, but great, and it wouldn’t begin to scratch the surface of how essential they are to the P+ community. UGS is phenomenal. Running TPS and other tournaments with them has done so much for my life and the community I love, I’m literally gonna start crying all over my laptop as I write this.</p>
         <p>I’ll shift subjects before I do. So I mentioned Undertow 1. I wasn’t exactly in charge of that iteration of the shadow-major, but I feel genuine in saying that a lot of it wouldn’t have ran half as well as it did without my intervention. From setup, stream running, hounding players to play matches, and putting out miscellaneous fires throughout the day (remember the heat getting turned on? I had to go ask the hotel twice to get the AC turned back on omg what the hell was that event). Thinking about Undertow 1 stresses me out, I’m gonna change subject again.</p>
         <p>How about the first <a id="articleLink" href="https://www.start.gg/tournament/tripoint-smash-128-ft-joey-s-birthday-bash/" target="_blank"> JBB</a>? That was a bit of a mess too; the venue allotted us about 2 hours to turn the empty TPS venue into a space holding tables for 30-ish CRTs and Wiis. God, the number of trips I took to the basement and back with the CRT cart…But people had a good time I think, even if things were a bit messy.</p>

         <img onclick="ToggleZoom('reImg3')" id="reImg3" class="article-body-image-bigger" src="https://github.com/pkzstar/plus-side/blob/main/images/Article-images/100tps/undertow.jpg?raw=true" alt="" tabindex="0">
         <p>Undertow was certainly a tournament</p>
         
         <p>If you haven’t noticed, these early events were a bit messy here and there. I definitely went through a transition (lol) as a TO during them. I wasn’t as good at improvising solutions as I eventually became. I’ve learned a ton since the earlier days, and that ability to snap make on-the-fly decisions is probably the most important thing I’ve learned as an organizer. It’s hard to overstate how essential I’ve found it. Without that skill, I’d be helplessly waiting for a PM-HDR-Ult player to eventually wander back to our side of the venue. Instead, I’m taking a minute to go out of my way to find the HDR TO, ask for that player asap, finding their opponent, giving them the heads up, and planting them at a setup so they can play the instant they get back. It’s a lot of little optimizations like that and being able to commit to them.</p>
         <p>The more tournaments I run, the more I figure out these little things to help keep things running smoothly and efficiently. The next most important thing I learned was getting over my shyness and just yelling for players. If you know me, you know I don’t have a very loud voice and I’ve always been a bit self-conscious about how I sound in general. But I think the first tournament where I said “fuck it,” and just yelled all day for players was during <a id="articleLink" href="https://www.start.gg/tournament/tripoint-smash-presents-super-tps-ii-combo-breaker-edition/events" target="_blank"> Combo Breaker 2022</a>. I ran the Melee and P+ side events there and from the getgo, I knew I was gonna have to shout. Call it exposure therapy cuz ever since then, I’ve basically stopped caring about yelling for players.</p>
         <p>The first event I was able to employ all these things at was definitely <a id="articleLink" href="https://www.start.gg/tournament/undertow-2022/" target="_blank"> Undertow 2</a>. This time around, I ran things for real as the head P+ TO. And the shit I learned paid off baby. Things were running on time (or ahead of schedule (including dubs!!)). I had a ton of people come up and thank me for running the tournament and telling me how much fun they had, how smooth everything went, and I heard that from people I care a lot about and god, we really made it with that event didn’t we? I’m gonna start crying again. Despite behind the scenes difficulties (not as many as 1, but still a decent handful), I’m still incredibly proud of how Undertow 2 ran. </p>
         <p>That success and those words would extend into <a id="articleLink" href="https://www.start.gg/tournament/joey-s-birthday-bash-2/" target="_blank"> Joey’s Birthday Bash 2</a>, which was the first time I ran a tournament where somebody told me it was their favorite event ever. It means so much to hear thanks from people at these tournaments. To put on something that means that much to members of the community I love so much is humbling and makes me want to never stop improving and continue running better and better events for everybody.</p>
         <img onclick="ToggleZoom('reImg4')" id="reImg4" class="article-body-image-bigger" src="https://github.com/pkzstar/plus-side/blob/main/images/Article-images/100tps/tps.jpeg?raw=true" alt="" tabindex="0">
         <p>Joey’s Birthday Bash 2 is probably the smoothest tournament I’ve ever ran (<a id="articleLink" href="https://bluerose.client-gallery.com/" target="_blank">bluerose.client-gallery.com/</a>)</p>
         <br>

         <p>The community is easily the biggest reason I’ve continued running these tournaments. To backtrack the timeline a little, in summer of 2022, I helped the rest of UGS run  <a id="articleLink" href="https://www.start.gg/tournament/warp-zone-1-300-in-pot-bonuses/events" target="_blank">WarpZone 1</a>. I was put in charge of top 64 and my laptop at the time had been through the ringer; it had been to every tournament I’d been to, it used to run the PM/Melee stream at ISU back in 2018. She had seen more work than any laptop should ever have to, and as soon as top 64 was done, she’d had enough. Start.gg froze up, my mouse stopped moving, and after forcing a shut-down, she refused to turn on again. I was frustrated but also worried. At the time, I was a substitute teacher and had very limited income balancing that with TOing, certainly not enough for a new laptop. I unbent my pride (read: “my millennial upbringing of being afraid to ask for help”) and reached out to the ILPM community, asking for help with buying a new laptop so I could continue running these tournaments. Everybody, not just IL, but the friends I’d made in the broader scene (Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Texas, the East Coast, and more), showed up and contributed: I had a new laptop funded in the span of a day. It made me emotional then and I’m still emotional about it today. That laptop is what I’m writing this article on right now, and it means so incredibly much to me that everybody cared enough to make that happen.</p>
         <p>So here we are at the tail end of summer 2023. It’s over 100 degrees out and I’m writing about a mod of a children’s party game. But if you’re reading this, you know that it’s much more than a funny mod of a funny game. This community has truly changed my life. My closest friends are or were people I met through PM. I have a stable career because of the opportunities granted me by running these events. Every week I get to put on a tournament for this game that's changed my life. This past month and a half, I ran no less than 4 big events: <a id="articleLink" href="https://www.start.gg/tournament/invincible-vii/events" target="_blank">Invincible VII</a>, <a id="articleLink" href="https://www.start.gg/tournament/warp-zone-2/details" target="_blank">Warp Zone 2</a>, <a id="articleLink" href="https://www.start.gg/tournament/pm-concert-symphony-a-midwest-p-invitational/events" target="_blank">PM Concert: Symphony</a>, and <a id="articleLink" href="https://www.start.gg/tournament/tripoint-smash-200/" target="_blank">Tripoint 200</a> which were all incredible, unique experiences in their own ways. I think the best part of all these tournaments is that they’ve all been similar stories to Undertow 2 and JBB2, if not smoother and cleaner. All of these events were delights to run and the people I worked with, my fellow PM community members who made them all possible, are similarly delightful.</p>

         <p>Warp Zone 2 was my personal favorite tournament I ran this year (<a id="articleLink" href="https://twitter.com/SoulOfficer" target="_blank">@SoulOfficer</a>)</p>
         <br>

         <p>To UGS, Wisconsin PM, metroid, and Ajay, none of this past month and a half would have been possible without all your hard work and dedication to the PM community. And to the rest of the community: Thank you for making this all worth it. It’s because you show up to these tournaments and play and create and love this game that any of this is even remotely possible and remotely as fulfilling. It’s because of you that I have a functioning laptop, a career, and some of the best friends I’ve ever had. That’s incredible to me.</p>
         <br>
         <p> ❤️ you all and I’ll see you at Undertow 2023 - Rosi</p>
