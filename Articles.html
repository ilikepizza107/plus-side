          It’s been over two years since Honeypot’s inception as a series, with the tournament approaching its sixth iteration this December. Honeypot has become such a mainstay tournament in the Project+ community post-quarantine that many assume it has been a part of the series since the first one. In reality, Project+ made its debut in the event lineup at Honeypot 2, and funnily enough, it has Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl to thank for it.

                The end of the year is fast approaching - with that comes more and more discussion on the year end rankings for Project+, PMRank. 
  In past years, the public has generally been left in the dark over the process of rankings, including what events qualify. But in 2023, the PMRank team announced strict guidelines  for its qualification process, and for the first time ever, events that qualify for PMRank are known to the public beforehand.

            The spark of resurgence started in Colorado Springs, with CoJoe starting the “Unstoppable” netplay bracket and eventually Valnoir’s house tournaments. Then, it spread to Denver, with Whoratio running the Lone Tree local [which eventually became Wavedash Wednesdays], and eventually spread further throughout the state. From being a side event for other Smash games, changing venues, and now a standalone local and major, P+ has taken a hold of Colorado and started a new era for the mod.

            Hey kids. I’ve been running P+ at Tripoint Smash for two and a half years. If you’ve been in the PM scene for any amount of time (god, we’re all old what happened), you’ll know that’s not terribly long, but I can also count helping out with Bloomington-Normal events, like ISmashU weeklies or running tiny events out of a card shop in La-Salle, Illinois.

              Ah, rankings season. While PM doesn’t do midyear rankings, mostly due to a much lesser depth of events compared to mainline Smash games, seeing those rankings come out always gets me in the spirit. Thus, I’ve decided to take a bit of time to highlight some of the players that have made significant rises over the first part of 2023. This won’t be everyone, of course (plenty of players have made their case for sure), but I’ll cover the most notable ones that I can think of.

              As the 2nd tournament in the trifecta of summer midwest majors and following up an eventful bracket at Invincible VII, Warp Zone 2 is looking to be an intense P+ bracket with loads of strong talent and over 100 entrants, including 17 current PMRank players, some former legends, and tons of rising stars.
