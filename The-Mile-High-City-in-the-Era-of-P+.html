      <h3>Written by<a href="https://twitter.com/FemmeboiRoy" target="_blank"> <p class="articleLink">@FemmeBoiRoy</p></a></h3>
      <p>Colorado was in an interesting spot at the start of 2020 during the release of P+. The days of 70 man locals were over and the scene was in a need for resurgence due to the way the pandemic affected everyone. </p>
      <img class="article-body-image-bigger" src="https://github.com/pkzstar/plus-side/blob/main/images/Article-images/mile-high-article/Screenshot+2023-09-14+162028.png?raw=true" alt="" tabindex="0">
      <div>A screenshot from the Unstoppable Netplay series, viewable <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1050859437" target="_blank"><p class="articleLink">here.</p></a></div>
        <br>
        <p>The spark of resurgence started in Colorado Springs, with CoJoe starting the ‚ÄúUnstoppable‚Äù netplay bracket and eventually Valnoir‚Äôs house tournaments. Then, it spread to Denver, with Whoratio running the Lone Tree local [which eventually became Wavedash Wednesdays], and eventually spread further throughout the state. From being a side event for other Smash games, changing venues, and now a standalone local and major, P+ has taken a hold of Colorado and started a new era for the mod. </p>
        
        <br>
        <p>In 2022, the idea began of hosting a modest regional named "Mile High Club" [MHC], with the hopes of gaining some interest from neighboring regions and a goal of around 60 players. Little did the TOs know that the Ghost of Regional‚Äôs Past, specifically "DU or Die 5", lived strong in the minds of players, and MHC became a national in no time. DU or Die 5 notably had a huge turnout of out of state players such as Sneez, Lamboa, Yink, CP9, Fingerstripes, and Cloudburst. CP9 claimed victory in this tournament without dropping a single set from pools to grand finals.</p>

        <br>

        <p>With free registration and the venue cap being hit in a week, MHC became one for the books. The event saw many upsets throughout, and Rongunshu claimed 1st place after making it through an intense bracket without dropping a single set. Some notable upsets included hometown hero Polear taking sets off Ivayne and CP9, along with Dr. Grin's massive upset over Nogh early on in the bracket, and Metroid knocking Nogh out in Loser's side of the bracket. There wasn't a moment without excitement, from cheering in the crowd to the stream chat, everyone was glued to their favorite player‚Äôs sets.</p>

         </div>

         <p>From the moment the event ended, the question was being whispered "What's next? Is this a one off or are we getting a new major in the Mile High city?", and little did they know the TOs already had plans. </p>
         <p>Immediately realizing 4/20/24 was a Saturday, and wanting the room to expand the event, the TOs instantly booked 4/20/24 and 4/21/24 with the venue. After the success that was MHC, they wondered what would happen with more than a whole year of planning time. Rumor has it, on a long car ride home from "The Back Hit", the name came to them, and MHC2 formally got dubbed, "The Bigger Mile High Club"</p>

         <p>With The Bigger Mile High Club being announced on 4/20/2023, and the increasing interest on the international level, new faces in the local scene, and talks of more local events, the scene has been coming back stronger than ever. The average player base for the last season was sitting between 20 to 30 for every Wednesday night local, with a stronger and more competitive revival. Outside of Denver and Colorado Springs, Longmont has seen a budding new local full of new faces.</p>

         </div>

         <p>In addition to the growing scene and Polear making waves on the national level, TO and consistent Colorado PR player, Whoratio, has been taking names as she improves. She made Top Cut at Shine Out of Shield and Top 24 at Honeypot 5 with her Yoshi. Each event her placement gets better and better, and soon she will be even more of a threat in bracket than she already is. On the local level, Shwang‚Äôs ROB has also consistently moved up in the Colorado PR the last few seasons, going from 9th to 5th in the most recent PR and keeping the trend going while consistently placing in the top 3 for a notable number of locals this current season. Other notable players on the rise are Meecrobs, who plays Zelda, and Guest, who plays Donkey Kong, both earning themselves spots as Honorable Mentions on the most recent PR. </p>

         <br>

         <p>Colorado has been getting more powerful with every season that passes and there are a lot of players to watch out from the local to the national level. From older players like CoJoe, Steel Kangaroo, and Jr Chaffles, to newer players like Polear, Whoratio, and Shwang, The Bigger Mile High Club is bound to have even more stunning results from the home region this coming year.</p>
