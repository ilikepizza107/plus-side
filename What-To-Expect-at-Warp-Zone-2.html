      <h1>What To Expect at Warp Zone 2</h1>
      <h3>Written by<a id="articleLink" href="https://twitter.com/princeshadrick"> @princeshadrick</a></h3>
      <br>
      <p>As the 2nd tournament in the trifecta of summer midwest majors and following up an eventful bracket at Invincible VII, Warp Zone 2 is looking to be an intense P+ bracket with loads of strong talent and over 100 entrants, including 17 current PMRank players, some former legends, and tons of rising stars. With all these amazing players coming together to Joliet, Illinois for this two day event, all eyes are on the top seeds, techboy, SipMastah, and Lunchables, to see if they can weather the storm or if they will fall to one of the plethora of players hungry to make an upset. With that said, here’s what to look out for heading into Warp Zone 2:</p>
        <br>

        <h2>The Return of Two Legends</h2>
        <div class="video-con">
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZmMzDP6PqDw?si=EZuS-qbrX2Dr-B6k" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="1" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
         </div>
        <p>Headlining this event is techboy’s return, with this being his first large event since Blacklisted 7, because of school taking up most of his time. Will the Icies extraordinaire continue the dominance that landed him the number 2 slot on PMRank 2022, and throw his hat into the conversation for number 1? His performance at Warp Zone 2 will answer that question.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Dirtboy and Cloudburst - A Tale of Two Squirtles</h2>
        <div class="video-con">
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RwlhPNsFOtQ?si=dHa2bMa4egjl3oR-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="1" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
         </div>
        <p>Despite Dirtboy and Cloudburst piloting the same character, the two have taken completely different paths this season. While Dirtboy historically has been a well traveled player, Cloudburst has been the one traveling to more out of region events, with an amazing 5th place at Mile High Club, defeating Kycse, Motobug, Ivayne, and Pikmon, a respectable 13th place at The Back Hit, beating CP9 and Rise, and a 1st place finish at Carnival Clash in Oregon, double eliminating Pikmon to win the tournament.</p>
        <p>Not to be outdone by his fellow Squirtle, Dirtboy has traveled as well, getting 4th at Exodus 2023 with an Ivayne win of his own along with a win on Sabre. His only other non-Midwest events were Tipped Off 14, where he ultimately fell to Aklo, claiming 2nd place, and a 1st place victory at Project Friendship 2 in Spain, playing on version 3.6. He ultimately came out on top over Europe’s number 1, Melody, but not without the Spanish Lucas resetting the bracket in grands.</p>
        <p>Dirtboy’s Midwest results have also been impressive, including a 1st place victory at House of Paign 23 with wins on Metroid, ORLY, and Michael, 3rd place at OddParty with wins on Star, Atomsk, and Chaloopy, and most recently a 4th place finish at Invincible VII, with wins on mawwwk, Star, Kendrick, and a runback win on Samantha after losing to the Knuckles rising star in pools. Both players have had great seasons, and Warp Zone 2 is looking to be the tournament that tips the scales for the title of best Squirtle.
        </p>

        <h2>Illinois Gears Up to Defend Their Home Turf</h2>
        <div class="video-con">
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EF4ifBIz8rk?si=tdzbusVMjcumwY9U" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="1" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
         </div>
        <p>With such strong out of region players like techboy, SipMastah, Pikmon, Bongo, Lunchables and more making the trek to Warp Zone 2, Illinois will have its hands full with trying to defend its home state from invaders. Despite that, there will be no shortage of talent trying to keep its home state from falling to outside competitors. Of course there are the 4 Illinois PMRank players, Comb, Chaloopy, ORLY, and metroid, who have made their mark on bigger events this year. Chaloopy’s 7th place at The Back Hit is the highest placing by an Illinois player at a non-Midwest event this year, and metroid’s win on Nogh at Mile High Club showed that the state deserves a seat at the table of top regions in PM.</p>
        <p>ORLY and Comb did well in their attempts to defend IL at Joey’s Birthday Bash 2 as well, claiming 3rd and 4th respectively. There’s one last member of PMRank 2023 from Illinois that hasn’t been mentioned - everyone’s favorite slip sensei, Che. Warp Zone 2 marks only the 2nd event he has been able to enter this year, the other being Joey’s Birthday Bash 2. The gods are seemingly doing everything in their power to prevent Che from laying his hands on a controller. With a strong run of 9th at JBB2 with wins on Ripple, Boat, and Tuck as our only Che sighting this year, many are eager to attend the slip seminar taking place during bracket to see if Che will be able to replicate that success.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Of course, PMRank isn’t the only place to find players looking to make a run in bracket. There is no shortage of hidden (and not so hidden) bosses that call Illinois home. First, there’s the premiere Wolf player in Illinois and one half of the Bertacchi brothers, Atomsk. Entering his first big event since Honeypot 5 after a 3-month break from locals, Atomsk is sure to be looking to make a big splash at Warp Zone 2. After a run that left much to be desired at JBB2, perhaps a break is just what Atomsk needed to return to form and take names.</p>
        <p>Next up, the Meta Knight/Shielda dual main C# is one of the better kept secrets in Illinois these days. However, those more familiar with the times of 3.6 will remember him being one of the stronger players in region, peaking at #4 multiple times on the Illinois PR. With recent local wins on metroid, ORLY, and evil lesbian, C# is still a very strong player with the skills to make a run deep into his first major event of the year after missing out on JBB2.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Finally, chief among Illinois PMRank hopefuls is Star, with strong performances at Joey’s Birthday Bash 2 and Mile High Club finally proving what most already knew: her explosive Lucas play is always a threat, with wins over Sothe, Fearless, Ellipsis, Thalia, and Che showcasing just how scary she can be. She hopes to carry the momentum from those big events to a deep bracket run at Warp Zone. Star’s performance will be one to watch. </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Lunchables and SipMastah - Maybe Everyone Should Pick Up 4 Characters!</h2>
        <div class="video-con">
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ozZXrtdbIao?si=PNIfjPkIXLsLIfv7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="1" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
         </div>
         <p>While most people choose to devote their time to one character, some decide to pick up a second character - usually as a counterpick or to protect against their first characters’ poor matchups. Even fewer people choose to pick up a third character, because balancing time, energy, and brainpower between all three is an arduous task not fit for many. However, these two players, Lunchables and SipMastah, have taken that notion and blown it out of the water.</p>
         <p>With their roster of four characters each, they have both had impressive seasons so far, with SipMastah only dropping sets this year to The Doctor, Rongunshu, and Stango, and Lunchables only dropping sets to DVD and Sosa. New to SipMastah’s character roster for Warp Zone 2 is Diddy Kong, a relatively underrepresented and underrated character since the switch to P+. Will SipMastah be able to propel Diddy Kong to the level of his main lineup, or will he have to rely on his more familiar trio of Meta Knight, Sonic, and Lucario? </p>
         <br>
         <p>Unlike SipMastah’s Diddy Kong, Lunchables’ fourth character, Meta Knight, is a more tested character, with it becoming his primary character this year. Marth and Toon Link make the rare cameo in bracket, with Roy seemingly all but forgotten. However, the last time we saw his Roy was at Undertow 2022 against techboy, so fans of his Roy may have something to look forward to. This switch seems to be working out just fine for Lunchables, sporting a 2nd place finish at JBB2 with wins on ORLY, Kendrick, Comb and Samantha, a 3rd place finish at The Back Hit with wins on jhamp, Chaloopy, and DVD, a first place finish at Honeypot 5 with wins on metroid and Atomsk, and another first place at Invincible VII with wins on Sothe, Chaloopy, ORLY, and Star. With both quad mains having stellar performances all year, all eyes will be on them to see how they fare against the field and a dormant techboy this weekend.</p>
         <br>
         <p>The second half of 2023 has kicked off for P+ with a bang already, and Warp Zone will surely continue the trend of exciting tournaments this year. With old and new faces present looking to make big waves in bracket, and a sea of out of region talent traveling in, Warp Zone is looking to be one of the most important tournaments of the year for players wanting to build their case for PMRank 2023.</p>
