      <h1>PMRank 2023's "Potential Players" List, Explained</h1>

      <p>The end of the year is fast approaching - with that comes more and more discussion on the year end rankings for Project+, PMRank. 
        In past years, the public has generally been left in the dark over the process of rankings, including what events qualify. But in 2023, the PMRank team announced strict guidelines for its qualification process, and for the first time ever, events that qualify for PMRank are known to the public beforehand.</p>

      <p>One of the qualifications for PMRank is the number of top players in attendance. Essentially, an event must feature at least 2 players featured on any of the last 3 PMRank top 50 rankings to qualify. This helps ensure that former top players still add to the weight of an event, even if they were absent from top 50 the year prior.</p>
      <p>But an interesting note is these top player slots can also go to “PMRank Potential Players”, a title attained by defeating 2 or more PMRank 2022 members. This new qualification allows players that have made waves this year add to a tournament’s importance. But who are those players? There’s nowhere public that holds all the list of these candidates, and viewing who they are can give an insight into who could appear on this year's PMRank top 50. So without further ado, let's look at PMRank 2023’s potential candidate list.</p>
     <br>
 
      <p>In an attempt to garner interest in the event, I’ve always tried to fly out one out of region competitor. For Honeypot 2, that player was Motobug; for Honeypot 3 it was Envy; and Honeypot 4 had Stango. They all made each event special, and definitely did the trick for getting people to come out to the event. Each time my expectations for the event have been blown out of the water, and I only have the people who came out to those events to thank for it. Even though I was somewhat absent for Honeypot 5 due to work, I was still so thankful that the event continued to persist and grow while I was away. </p>
     
 
 
      <p>I want to make this very clear: Honeypot Project+ as it is would not exist without RosiYY, Che, and UGS. Each tournament ran smoothly and was a pleasure to view because of them. When start.gg went down during Honeypot 4, RosiYY started writing down paper brackets to ensure the event continued on time. She has been the reason these brackets have run the way they have, and I can’t thank her enough for it. Che has always been there to stream the event, and clutched up a stream setup when we thought we weren’t going to have one for Honeypot 5. He’s done an amazing job running the stream, and has always made it a treat to watch.</p>

      <p>Honeypot 6 is looking to be a great time, and this is the most stacked bracket the tournament has ever seen. The out of region talent is higher than ever, with Rongunshu descending from Ontario to tear up another bracket, and SipMastah hot off of a win from Against All Odds. With the series shifting to a two day format, we worried that the event attendance might take a hit, but thankfully we were very wrong. At the time of writing registration hit over 70 entrants for the event, with every coast coming out to the Putnam museum in the outskirts of Iowa. I’m so thankful to everyone who’s making the trip, and everyone planning on watching the event from afar on ProjectMNexus. Honeypot would not be where we are without you. Thank you.</p>
